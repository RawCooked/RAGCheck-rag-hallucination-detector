"""The core of the project: decides whether a claim is actually supported
by the retrieved evidence, using Natural Language Inference (NLI) rather
than surface-level similarity. NLI catches cases embedding similarity
misses -- e.g. "Lincoln was the seventeenth President" sits right next to
"Lincoln was the sixteenth President" in embedding space (same entities,
same topic), so a similarity-only check would call it supported. An NLI
model reads the two sentences as a (premise, hypothesis) pair and asks
"does the premise logically entail the hypothesis?" -- and correctly says
no, because sixteenth != seventeenth.

Model: cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-base, a DeBERTa-v3 model fine-tuned
directly for 3-way NLI classification (entailment / neutral /
contradiction) on MNLI+SNLI+FEVER. Loaded via sentence-transformers'
CrossEncoder, which scores a (premise, hypothesis) pair in one forward
pass -- unlike the bi-encoder used for retrieval, which embeds each text
separately and can only compare embeddings after the fact.

Known limitations (both verified empirically):

1. Off-topic pairs read as contradiction, not neutral. This model was
   trained on premise/hypothesis pairs that are topically related. Given
   a genuinely unrelated pair (e.g. a premise about Uruguay's population
   and a hypothesis about the Eiffel Tower), it confidently predicts
   "contradiction" instead of "neutral" -- MNLI's "neutral" label means
   "related but not fully entailed," not "unrelated." This is a real risk
   here, but a bounded one: evidence_chunks are always chunks retrieved
   for the *question* the claim's answer was generated from, so premise
   and hypothesis are rarely topically unrelated in practice.

2. Multi-sentence premises collapse the entailment signal. Cross-encoder
   NLI models are trained on single-sentence (premise, hypothesis) pairs
   (SNLI/MNLI/FEVER). Fed a whole ~150-word retrieved chunk as the
   premise, a claim that is a verbatim sentence from that chunk scored
   98.7% entailment against just that one sentence, but only 0.3%
   (99.7% "neutral") against the full chunk containing it -- the signal
   gets diluted by the surrounding, differently-focused sentences. Fixed
   below by decomposing each evidence chunk into individual sentences
   (via src/claims/extractor.py's split_into_sentences(), shared so both
   call sites behave consistently) and scoring the claim against every
   sentence from every chunk, not each chunk as one block. This matches
   the approach used in factual-consistency-checking research (e.g.
   SummaC, Laban et al. 2022) for exactly this reason.

    Each chunk is first split into individual sentences (see limitation 2
    in this module's docstring for why), and the claim is scored against
    every sentence from every chunk -- not just the top retrieval hit,
    since the passage that best matches the *question* isn't always the
    one whose specific sentence best supports a given *claim*.

    A claim is judged ENTAILMENT if any evidence sentence's entailment
    probability clears entailment_threshold. Failing that, it's
    CONTRADICTION if some sentence's contradiction probability clears
    contradiction_threshold. Otherwise NEUTRAL: no retrieved evidence
    speaks to this claim either way, which -- for a hallucination
    detector -- is just as much a red flag as an outright contradiction.

    Args:
        claim_text: a single atomic claim (see src/claims/extractor.py).
